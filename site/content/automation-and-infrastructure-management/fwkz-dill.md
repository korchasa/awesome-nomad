Dill is a cloud-ready L4 TCP proxy that enhances load balancing and routing with support for dynamic listeners. It allows users to expose dynamic backends on static frontend ports, facilitating the management of complex routing in modern application scenarios. The proxy can integrate with various routing providers, including Consul and Nomad, allowing for live updates to traffic routing without downtime. Moreover, it offers an easy setup procedure, with options for configuration through files, HTTP endpoints, and service discovery, making it versatile and user-friendly.
