$ cat description.txt
Nomad Pipeline is a tool that enables the execution of pipeline-style workloads in HashiCorp's Nomad with job dependencies management. It allows users to define task groups with metadata to control the execution order and dependencies between them. Users can run tasks in parallel and have dynamic tasks that generate further tasks based on the output of previous ones. Additionally, features such as job level leaders and handling URL-friendly environment variables enhance its usability for managing complex workflows.
