$ cat description.txt
This project is a Terraform module for setting up Nomad clusters with Consul on Google Cloud Platform. It includes features such as gossip encryption, mTLS, and ACLs for both Nomad and Consul. Additionally, the module offers optional configurations for load balancing, SSH bastion hosting, and Docker task management, enhancing its infrastructure management capabilities. It also facilitates centralized logging and monitoring through integration with GCP's Cloud Logging, Promtail, Loki, and Grafana, thereby enriching the operational oversight of deployed applications.
