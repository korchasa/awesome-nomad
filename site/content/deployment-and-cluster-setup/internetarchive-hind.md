$ cat description.txt
HinD is a project that simplifies the setup of a Nomad cluster by integrating it with Consul and Caddy server in a single Docker container. It allows users to orchestrate containers using Nomad, leveraging podman for deploying services seamlessly. The project emphasizes automated service discovery and reverse proxy capabilities, utilizing caddyserver and consul-template to manage routing and SSL certificates on-the-fly. It is especially useful for developers looking to quickly bootstrap a Nomad environment for microservices and containerized applications.
