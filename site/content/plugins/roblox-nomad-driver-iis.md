$ cat description.txt
The 'Roblox/nomad-driver-iis' project is a plugin for Nomad, a flexible workload orchestrator, designed to manage and run IIS (Internet Information Services) website tasks on Windows servers. This driver allows for the orchestration of tasks related to IIS websites by creating application pools and sites using Nomad's allocation IDs. The project includes robust documentation on setting up, configuring, and testing the plugin, and it emphasizes compatibility with Windows 2016 and newer versions. The plugin facilitates integration with Nomad via the use of Nomad job specifications, making it possible to orchestrate IIS services seamlessly within a Nomadic environment. It provides additional capabilities such as environment variables configuration and incorporates meta environment variables for enhanced security through integrations with tools like consul and vault.
