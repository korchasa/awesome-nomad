$ cat description.txt
GoCast is a tool that performs controlled BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route announcements from a host, allowing for effective load balancing of services like DNS across geographically diverse regions. It operates by running predefined health checks to determine whether to announce or withdraw routes for services, particularly those utilizing Virtual IPs (VIPs) for anycast load balancing. GoCast leverages the GoBGP library for communication with remote peers and supports automatic service discovery and health checking through integrations with Consul. This robust setup positions GoCast as a reliable component for managing network routes in environments overseen by orchestration tools such as Nomad.
