$ cat description.txt
Nomad UI is a user interface designed for managing HashiCorp's Nomad clusters. Developed using .NET Core and React, it allows users to interact with and manage their Nomad environments seamlessly. The project supports containerized deployments via Docker, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. While it was under active development, the introduction of a built-in UI in Nomad 0.7 means this project is no longer actively maintained, but it still serves as a valuable UI tool for users.
