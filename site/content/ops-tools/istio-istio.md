$ cat description.txt
Istio is an open source service mesh that provides a uniform way to secure, connect, and observe services. It layers transparently over existing distributed applications and offers powerful features for load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and telemetry gathering. The platform comprises critical components like Envoy (for traffic management) and Istiod (the control plane for managing services). By providing these capabilities without altering application code, Istio plays a significant role in modern cloud-native application management.
