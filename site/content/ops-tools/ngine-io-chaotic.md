$ cat description.txt
Chaotic is a tool designed to introduce controlled chaos into cloud environments for the purpose of testing and enhancing the resilience of operations. It interacts with various cloud services like DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner Cloud, and others to simulate failures by stopping and restarting services. This can be scheduled as one-off tasks or run periodically as a daemon. Chaotic also supports customization through configuration files where you can specify when to exclude real actions and perform dry runs, making it versatile for different testing scenarios. Its main goal is to help developers and operators understand how their applications will respond under conditions of stress, ultimately aiding in the development of more robust systems.
