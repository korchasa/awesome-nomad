$ cat description.txt
The Deadman Check project serves as a monitoring companion for Nomad periodic jobs and Cron jobs, notifying users if these jobs are not running as expected. It can function as an additional task in a Nomad job or as a standalone service that oversees multiple jobs. The setup allows for alerts via Slack or AWS SNS, effectively helping operators maintain and manage their jobs in real-time. This tool emphasizes operational reliability and monitoring, which are crucial for effective infrastructure management.
