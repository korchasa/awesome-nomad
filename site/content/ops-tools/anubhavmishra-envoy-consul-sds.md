$ cat description.txt
The 'envoy-consul-sds' project implements a service discovery system using Envoy and Consul, aimed at facilitating the registration and discovery of services on Nomad. This service operates on the Envoy SDS API to provide a list of healthy endpoints for Envoy, which can be utilized as upstream backends for clusters. It is a tutorial-based project derived from Kelsey Hightower's Kubernetes-Envoy Service Discovery tutorial, adapted to use Consul and Nomad instead. The project includes comprehensive guides on setting up the Nomad infrastructure, deploying Envoy, and integrating it with services like Nginx.
