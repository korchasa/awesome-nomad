$ cat description.txt
The 'nomctx' tool allows users to switch rapidly between different Nomad clusters and namespaces. It simplifies the cumbersome process of exporting environment variables required for the Nomad CLI, providing an easy way to manage multiple infrastructures. Users can configure and authenticate various clusters through a single configuration file, enhancing efficiency in a multi-cluster environment. This tool is particularly beneficial for developers and operators working with HashiCorp Nomad who need to manage their contexts conveniently and effectively.
