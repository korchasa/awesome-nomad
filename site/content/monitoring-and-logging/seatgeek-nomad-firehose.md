$ cat description.txt
The `nomad-firehose` is a tool that facilitates the monitoring of changes in Nomad job, allocation, nodes, and evaluations, and pushes those changes to various outputs. It allows teams to quickly build logic around Nomad task events without needing to interact directly with the Nomad API. Built to be easily deployed across different platforms, it supports multiple sink configurations including Kafka, Redis, and others. This project effectively streamlines the monitoring process in a Nomad environment, offering a range of outputs for dynamic event handling.
