This project is a practical event-driven microservices coffee shop application that utilizes Golang and various tools from HashiCorp for deployment. It demonstrates interaction between different services such as product, counter, barista, and kitchen services along with a frontend interface. The technical stack includes GRPC, RabbitMQ, and Postgres, showcasing a clean, domain-driven design. It provides a deployment guide using Nomad and Consul Connect for orchestrating the services in a reproducible development environment.
