      description: The nomad-vector-logger is a daemon designed to monitor jobs running within a Nomad cluster and create a Vector configuration file that collects application logs enriched with metadata from Nomad. It resolves the limitation of ordinary logs lacking contextual information by enriching them with metadata such as namespace, node, job, group, task, and allocation ID. This tool facilitates better log management for tasks that may not have extensive logging configurations, such as those using the raw_exec or exec task drivers. The generated configuration allows users to easily set up log collection with detailed context about each log event, ultimately enhancing observability and troubleshooting capabilities in their applications.
